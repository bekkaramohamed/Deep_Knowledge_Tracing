## ðŸ“š Introduction

Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT) is a deep learning model used to track a student's knowledge over time. The goal of DKT is to predict a student's future performance on educational tasks based on their past performance. By leveraging LSTM Neural Networks, DKT can model the temporal dynamics of a student's learning process, offering personalized feedback and targeted interventions to enhance learning outcomes.
